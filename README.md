generate informed, evidence-based forecasts:
  * Service statistics (test numbers)
  * Logistics data (consumption)
  * Demographic (program targets)
* Able to import high volumes of data from MS-Excel template file
* Compares forecasting methodologies to identify programmatic and commodity gaps
* Analyzes actual and forecasted instrument utilization, diagnostics contribution, and instrument diversity
